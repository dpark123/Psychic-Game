# Psychic-Game

This is a simple progam in which the user tries to guess the letter the computer is thinking of.

The computer generates a random letter and when the user presses a letter, the program will compare the user's input with the computers random choice. If the input is equal to the computer's choice the user wins and the counter will go up and the game resets.
The user will have 9 chances to guess correctly. If the user does not guess correctly within the allotted turns then the user will lose, the lose counter will go up, and the game resets.
As the user inputs a letter, the letter will be displayed on the page.
